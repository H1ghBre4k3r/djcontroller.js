# djcontroller.js

A library for interacting with MIDI DJ controllers in JavaScript.

## Features

The library is...

- **Compatible:** By using [Mixxx](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx)'s mapping format, it is compatible with a [wide range of controllers](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/tree/main/res/controllers) out of the box.
- **Extensible:** Adding custom DJ controllers is easy.
- **Lightweight:** By operating entirely abstractly in terms of interfaces it can be used anywhere, including in browsers and Node.js-based environments.
